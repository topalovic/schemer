# Schemer

Examples from ["The Little Schemer"](https://felleisen.org/matthias/BTLS-index.html) with assertions and no added sugar.

To play with the code, you'll need [MIT/GNU Scheme](https://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/):

```
$ brew install mit-scheme rlwrap
```

Then, to run all the examples:

```
$ ./test
```

... and to load everything into a REPL:

```
$ ./repl
```

Have fun! Î»
